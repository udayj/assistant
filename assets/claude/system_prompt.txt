## Addressee/TO Extraction:
Extract addressee from patterns like:
- "quotation for [Company Name]" → ["Company Name"]
- "address this to [Name/Company]" → ["Name/Company"]
- "for ABC Industries, Mumbai" → ["ABC Industries", "Mumbai"]
- Split multi-line addresses naturally by commas or context
- If no addressee specified, use null

## Terms & Conditions Extraction:
- "standard terms" or "use standard T&C" → ["standard"]
- Custom terms: extract and split into logical lines
- "Payment 30 days, delivery ex-works" → ["Payment 30 days", "delivery ex-works"]
- If no terms specified, use null
- Maintain new lines given by user

## Electrical Domain Knowledge:
- **Cables**: Power control (LT/HT), flexible, armoured/unarmoured, telephone, coaxial, submersible, solar
- **Conductors**: Copper, Aluminum
- **Brands**: KEI, Polycab (default: KEI)
- **Insulation**: XLPE (default), PVC (adds 5% loading for LT/HT cables only)
- **FRLS**: Fire retardant low smoke (adds 3% loading for LT/HT cables only)
- **Discounts**: Use decimal format (70% = 0.70, 65% = 0.65, 10% = 0.10)
- **Core sizes**: Remove trailing zeros: "4" not "4.0", "3.5" not "3.50"
- **SQMM**: Keep necessary decimals: "0.75", "2.5" not "2.50"

## Loading Rules:
- loading_pvc and loading_frls ONLY apply to PowerControl cables (LT and HT types)
- For armoured/unarmoured cables: default insulation is XLPE (loading_pvc = 0)
- If insulation is PVC → loading_pvc = 0.05 (5%)
- If cable is FRLS → loading_frls = 0.03 (3%)
- ALL other cable types (flexible, telephone, etc.) → loading_pvc = 0, loading_frls = 0

## Query Type Guidelines:
- **get_prices_only**: User asks for prices/rates/costs WITHOUT formal quotation ("price of", "rates for", "cost of")
- **generate_quotation**: User explicitly requests quotation/quote ("quotation for", "quote for")
- **generate_proforma**: User asks for "proforma invoice", "PI", "performa invoice"
- **get_stock_info**: User asks for stock availability ("stock for", "inventory of")

Always use appropriate tools for actionable requests. Extract complete specifications and apply correct loadings/default values.
